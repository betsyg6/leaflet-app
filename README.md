# React-Leaflet Medium Demo

This project was created to show other developers how to use react-leaflet to create a map app that uses geolocation and allows a user to click and add locations. I decided to create this source code after creating my web application, [Map It](https://mapitapp.herokuapp.com/), and struggling through the documentation to get react-leaflet to function as I wanted it to. Since I created Map It, there have been updates to react-leaflet that make these functions easier to accomplish. However, I still believe this demo will be useful to other developers.

To view the code, go to src > App.js, or download this repo, npm install, and npm start.
